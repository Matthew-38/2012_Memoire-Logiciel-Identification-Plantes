##########Introduction###########
This is a test version, a beta for Flora Diversa which aims to be an electronic Flora to cover Irish (and eventually British...) flora. 
Flora Diversa is written by Matthew O'Toole. I started the project as my Bachelor Thesis at NUI Galway (supervisor: Zoë A. Popper) but decided to continue this project so that it may see use.
The current version covers 30 native, naturalised or very common tree (and big shrub) species of Ireland. It also mentions other subspecies and similar plants for comparison. Due to the small number of plant profiles included, the use of the programme at this point is quite limited. 
However it is meant as a demonstration of what can be done and shows how it works, as well as giving one an idea of its potential.

#########Limits and Bugs#####
Please Note: The programme data does NOT cover any Willows, Poplars or similar species. These were purposefully excluded due to their complexity and large number of species. They will require a good deal of attention and work.
There are likely several bugs in this version. For this reason, there an automatic logging system in the programme (disabled by default). To enable it, go to the settings.txt file and change "log mode:t" to "log mode:tf".

#####How to use the programme####
This section describes how to use the programme. In order to use the programme to assist in identification it is recommended that the you carefully observe the plant and then use the drop-down menus, lists, feature selectors and numerical entry boxes in order to choose the various character states observed for the plant. 
For some characters additional help and descriptions are given either through text boxes or images for example to describe leaf margins and shape. 
For details about the programme structure and working, see the Overview.

1. Observe the plant material carefully.
	
2. Open the programme and select the appropriate mode. The advanced mode is designed for users familiar with scientific terminology whereas the beginner mode is designed for all other users. (In this version, only the beginner mode is fully functional)

3. Select the characters which you feel most closely describe your plant material.

4. If there are characters which are missing, e.g. flowers or fruits, these can be left unselected (as 'unsure').

5. If there are character states that you do not understand then use the additional information provided by the tooltips which appear when you mouse-over them to further investigate their meaning.

6. If you are uncertain about specific characters then you can enter your confidence level regarding that character using the percentage selector (not available on the current version).

7. Once you are satisfied that you have entered all of the information about the plant that you can, then you should examine the programme output. There may be more than one possible species. However, further text and images which are given should help you to arrive with a reasonable degree of confidence for an identification.

8. If you think that you have the right plant, click on View Details. Here you can see the plant description as well as details of similar plants and subspecies (where relavant). Additionally you can see the photos in detail.

9. If you hesitate between 2 or more plants, you can compare them in the Plant View window (bottom left).

If you fail to find your plant, it could well be that the profile data is lacking from this current version which includes about 30 trees and shrubs common (native/naturalised) of Ireland. Many trees found in streets and roadsides are often planted aliens which are unlikely included in this version.
If you suspect that it may be due to error (either your mistake/uncertainty or in the data) you can adjust the error tolerance level in the Settings window.
