Native Status	Ireland,native,Britain,native
Soil Preference	wet, fixes nitrogen (via bacteria)
Description	Usually a waterside tree, Alder is identified by its dark, almost circular leaves and woody, cone-like fruiting catkins which persist for much of the year. Suckering often results in a bushy growth. It has bacteria in its root nodules which fix nitrogen. Flowers are catkins and appear before the leaves.
