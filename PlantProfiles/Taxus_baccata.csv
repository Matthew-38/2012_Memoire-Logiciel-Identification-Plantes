Description	Often planted solitarily in grave yeards and can live many years and have hollow trunks, Yew has distinctive flattened needle-like leaves with 2 green-yellow bands underside. The leaves, which are darker green than most other connifers, are borne opposite in a 2d form, or spirally on upright shoots. Very toxic!
