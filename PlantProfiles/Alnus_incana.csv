#Root
#Misc
Name	Alnus incana
Common Name	Alder, Grey Alder
Frequency	rare
Subspecies	none
Data Source(s)	Webb 1963,CTW 1962, Johnson 2004
Similar Plants	Alnus glutinosa,Common Alder has almost circular leaves which usually have an inverted tip (emarginate). The leaves look almost the same top and underside. It has less smooth and more fissured grey bark.
Native Status	Ireland,simi-naturalised,Britain,simi-naturalised
Soil Preference	wet, fixes nitrogen (via bacteria)
Description	Usually planted for shelter and on poor soils, Grey Alder is destinguished by its dark, almost circular leaves which are pale or greyish underside (this and its pointed form tells it appart from common Alder). As fruit it has woody, cone-like fruiting catkins which persist for much of the year. Suckering often results in a bushy growth. It has bacteria in its root nodules which fix nitrogen. Flowers are catkins and appear before the leaves.
